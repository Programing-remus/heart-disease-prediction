# Heart disease risk prediction and cardiac health evaluation system
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
__Description__: This project was developped as my CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python final project and its main objective is to accurately predict the probability of heart disease of a patient based on the input of a set of heart health related parameters, namely cholesterol levels and blood pressure registrations. 
#### Features
+ Predict heart disease risk with logistic regression
+ Assess whether each of the inputs is within a healthy range
+ Provides a clearer view of possible risk factors

#### Implementation
For the first part of the project, I decided to implement a Logistics Regression Model. In order to get a better understanding of how to implement the model from scratch, I made the mathematic deductions by hand and then translated them into code, using the numpy library. At its core a Logistics Regression Model training script takes a matrix with m instances (lines) and n parameters (coumns) - X - and a vector with a binary label (0 or 1) with m values (one for each instance in X)
